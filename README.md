This is a repostiory dedicate to downloading and processing of solar wind data for space physics applications and studies.\
We base this code around the OMNI 1-min data but tools should have extended application.

## Please implement extra changes and suggestions in a fork and let us know
### Current Limitations
- Download uses wget. For use for windows os urlib should be implemented
- We have only implemented the newell coupling function. Please add new ones such as Milan so others can use it.
